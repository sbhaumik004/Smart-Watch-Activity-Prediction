# Smart-Watch-Activity-Prediction

verview
This project builds a Random Forest machine learning model to predict user activities based on smartwatch sensor data. The dataset contains various sensor readings such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and heart rate, which are used to classify activities like walking, running, sitting, standing, and cycling.


üèó Project Workflow
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Load dataset
Handle missing values
Normalize numerical features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Sensor data visualization
Activity distribution analysis
Feature Engineering:
Extract meaningful time-series features
Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (if needed)
Model Training & Evaluation:
Train/Test split 
Train Random Forest Classifier
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score


üìä Results
